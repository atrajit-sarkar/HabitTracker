### Dynamic Message Generation
Each state has Gemini-powered messages:

**NO_OVERDUE Prompt:**
```
Generate a motivating 'good morning' or 'new day' message (max 20 words) 
for someone starting their day with no overdue habits. 
Be encouraging and positive. Don't use emojis.
```

**ONE_OVERDUE Prompt:**
```
Generate a motivating reminder (max 20 words) to complete habit '[habit]'. 
Be encouraging but firm. Don't use emojis.
```

**MULTIPLE_OVERDUE Prompt:**
```
Generate a firm, urgent message (max 20 words) for someone with X overdue habits. 
Be direct and motivating. Create urgency. Don't use emojis.
```

**ALL_DONE Prompt:**
```
Generate a congratulatory message (max 20 words) for someone who 
completed all X habits today. Be proud and encouraging. Don't use emojis.
```

### Fallback Messages

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Widget Logic

```kotlin
// Determine state based on:
1. scheduledToday: Habits that should be done today
2. overdueHabits: Past due time, not completed
3. completedToday: Already completed

State priority:
1. No habits scheduled → NO_OVERDUE
2. All completed → ALL_DONE
3. One overdue → ONE_OVERDUE
4. Multiple overdue → MULTIPLE_OVERDUE
5. Waiting for time → NO_OVERDUE
```

### Update Triggers
Widget updates on:
- ✅ Habit completion
- ➕ Habit creation
- ✏️ Habit editing
- 🗑️ Habit deletion
- 🔄 Every 30 minutes (automatic)
- 🔄 App startup
