---

## Step 2: Build Your App Bundle

### 2.1 Ensure You Have Keystore

**Check if you have** `keystore.properties` **file** in project root.

**If you DON'T have it**, create it now:

1. In project root, create file: `keystore.properties`
2. Add this content:
```properties
RELEASE_STORE_FILE=../your-keystore-name.jks
RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD=YourStorePassword
RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS=YourKeyAlias
RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD=YourKeyPassword
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
GITHUB_TOKEN_MUSIC_REPO=your_music_token_here
SMTP_AUTH_EMAIL=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your_app_password
EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=your_email@gmail.com
```

**If you DON'T have a keystore file**, create one:

```powershell
# In your project directory
keytool -genkey -v -keystore habittracker-release-key.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias habittracker

# You'll be asked:
Enter keystore password: [Create a strong password]
Re-enter password: [Same password]
What is your first and last name? [Your name]
What is the name of your organizational unit? [Your team/company]
What is the name of your organization? [Your company or personal]
What is the name of your City or Locality? [Your city]
What is the name of your State or Province? [Your state]
What is the two-letter country code for this unit? [US, IN, UK, etc.]

# Save password somewhere safe!
```

**CRITICAL**: 
- **NEVER lose your keystore file or password!**
- **NEVER commit it to GitHub!**
- **Make multiple backups!**
- You can't update your app without the same keystore

### 2.2 Build the App Bundle

**Open PowerShell in your project directory** and run:

```powershell
.\build-playstore-bundle.ps1
```

**What happens:**
1. Cleans previous builds
2. Compiles your app
3. Signs with your release key
4. Creates AAB file
5. Takes 1-2 minutes

**Output location:**
```
app\build\outputs\bundle\playstoreRelease\app-playstore-release.aab
```

**Verify the build:**
- File size: Should be 15-50 MB (approximately)
- Extension: Must be `.aab` (not `.apk`)
- Dated: Today's date

### 2.3 Test Your Bundle (Optional but Recommended)

**Option A: Install via bundletool**
```powershell
# Download bundletool
# https://github.com/google/bundletool/releases

# Generate APKs from bundle
java -jar bundletool-all.jar build-apks --bundle=app\build\outputs\bundle\playstoreRelease\app-playstore-release.aab --output=app.apks --ks=your-keystore.jks --ks-key-alias=your-alias

# Install to connected device
java -jar bundletool-all.jar install-apks --apks=app.apks
```

**Option B: Upload to Play Console Internal Testing**
- Upload AAB to Internal Testing track
- Install via Play Store
- Test all features
