# Music Screen Improvements

## Date: October 19, 2025

## Changes Made

### 1. Track Count Display
**Feature:** Show the number of tracks fetched from the repository

**Implementation:**
- Added a badge next to "Available Tracks" title
- Displays total track count with music note icon
- Styled with Material 3 secondary container color
- Format: "X tracks" (e.g., "18 tracks")

**UI Location:**
```
Available Tracks                    ðŸŽµ 18 tracks
[Badge with count in top right]
```

### 2. Fixed "No Music" Glitch
**Bug:** When "No Music" was selected while music was enabled, the music would continue playing

**Root Cause:**
- The `changeSong(NONE)` function would stop music, but because `isEnabled` was still true, subsequent checks wouldn't enforce the stop
- The UI wasn't explicitly calling `stopMusic()` when NONE was selected

**Fix Applied:**

#### MusicSettingsScreen.kt
```kotlin
if (selectedTrack == "NONE") {
    // Stop any playing music immediately when NONE is selected
    manager.stopMusic()
    manager.changeSong(BackgroundMusicManager.MusicTrack.NONE)
    Log.d("MusicSettings", "Changed to NONE track - music stopped")
}
```

#### BackgroundMusicManager.kt
```kotlin
fun changeSong(newSong: MusicTrack) {
    if (currentSong != newSong || newSong == MusicTrack.NONE) {
        // Always stop the current song first to prevent overlap
        stopMusic()
        
        currentSong = newSong
        currentDynamicFileName = null // Clear dynamic file when using enum
        
        Log.d("BackgroundMusic", "changeSong - newSong: ${newSong.name}, isEnabled: $isEnabled")
        
        if (isEnabled && newSong != MusicTrack.NONE) {
            startMusic()
        } else if (newSong == MusicTrack.NONE) {
            Log.d("BackgroundMusic", "NONE selected - music stopped")
        }
    }
}
```

**Key Changes:**
1. **Explicit stopMusic() call** in UI when NONE is selected
2. **Modified condition** in `changeSong()` to always process NONE selection (even if currentSong is already NONE)
3. **Added logging** to track NONE selection behavior
4. **Clears dynamic filename** to prevent any lingering references
