## 🔒 Security Model

### Authentication Required
- ✅ **ALL operations** require Firebase Authentication
- ✅ No anonymous access (except public storage reads)
- ✅ User ID validation on all writes

### Data Isolation
- ✅ Users can **ONLY** access their own private data
- ✅ Users **CANNOT** read/modify other users' habits, completions, settings
- ✅ Private collections are completely isolated per user

### Social Features Security
- ✅ **Public Profiles**: Readable by authenticated users (for leaderboard/friend search)
- ✅ **Friend Requests**: Only sender and recipient can see
- ✅ **Friendships**: Both parties can view and delete
- ✅ **Chats**: Only participants can access

### Data Validation
- ✅ **Required Fields**: Enforced for all writes
- ✅ **Type Validation**: Correct data types required
- ✅ **Size Limits**: String lengths validated
- ✅ **Range Checks**: Numeric values within valid ranges
- ✅ **Email Validation**: Proper email format required
- ✅ **File Types**: Image/audio validation for uploads
- ✅ **File Sizes**: 10MB images, 50MB audio enforced

## 📋 What to Do Next

### Step 1: Review
- [ ] Read `FIREBASE_RULES_GUIDE.md` for detailed explanations
- [ ] Check `FIREBASE_RULES_QUICK_REF.md` for quick reference
- [ ] Review `firestore.rules` and `storage.rules` files

### Step 2: Backup
- [ ] Export current rules from Firebase Console (if any exist)
- [ ] Save backup locally
- [ ] Document current state

### Step 3: Deploy
- [ ] Follow `FIREBASE_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`
- [ ] Deploy to Firebase (console or CLI)
- [ ] Verify deployment success

### Step 4: Test
- [ ] Test app functionality after deployment
- [ ] Verify all features work correctly
- [ ] Monitor Firebase Console for errors
- [ ] Check denied requests in Usage tab

### Step 5: Monitor
- [ ] Watch for permission errors (first 24 hours)
- [ ] Review user feedback
- [ ] Check performance metrics
- [ ] Adjust rules if needed

## 🔄 Future Considerations

### Features to Add (When Needed)

1. **Admin Panel**: Add custom claims for admin users
```javascript
function isAdmin() {
  return request.auth.token.admin == true;
}
```

2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement application-level rate limits
3. **Soft Deletes**: Add isDeleted flags where needed
4. **Audit Logging**: Log sensitive operations
5. **Email Verification**: Require verified email for certain features

### Maintenance Tasks

- **Monthly**: Review denied request logs
- **Quarterly**: Audit permissions and access patterns
- **After Updates**: Update rules for new features
- **Yearly**: Complete security audit

## 🎨 Rules Philosophy

The rules follow these principles:

1. **Secure by Default**: Deny everything not explicitly allowed
2. **User Privacy First**: Users control their own data
3. **Social Features Enabled**: Public data for friends/leaderboard
4. **Validation at Edge**: Catch bad data before it reaches database
5. **Performance Conscious**: Efficient rule evaluation
6. **Future-Proof**: Easy to extend for new features
