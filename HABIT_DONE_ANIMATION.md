# Habit Done Animation Implementation

## Overview
Added a celebration animation that appears when a user marks a habit as complete. The animation displays as a full-screen overlay for 4 seconds with smooth fade in/out transitions.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Animation Conversion
**Source:** `habit-done.mp4`
**Output:** `habit_done_anim.json`
- **Size:** 245.98 KB
- **Frames:** 18 frames
- **FPS:** 12
- **Duration:** 1494ms (loops continuously)
- **Background Removal:** AI-based (rembg with U2-Net model)
- **Location:** `app/src/main/assets/habit_done_anim.json`

### 2. Code Changes

#### HomeScreen.kt Modifications:

1. **State Management** (Line ~379)
   ```kotlin
   // Habit done animation state - tracks which habit was just completed
   var showHabitDoneAnimation by remember { mutableStateOf<Long?>(null) }
   ```

2. **Trigger Animation on Completion** (Line ~874)
   ```kotlin
   onMarkCompleted = { 
       // Show habit done animation for all themes
       showHabitDoneAnimation = habit.id
       
       // Show Sharingan animation only for Itachi theme
       if (currentTheme == AppTheme.ITACHI) {
           showSharinganAnimation = true
       }
       onMarkHabitCompleted(habit.id) 
   }
   ```

3. **Animation Overlay Call** (Line ~1037)
   ```kotlin
   // Habit done animation overlay - shows when any habit is completed
   showHabitDoneAnimation?.let { habitId ->
       HabitDoneAnimationOverlay(
           onAnimationComplete = { showHabitDoneAnimation = null }
       )
   }
   ```

4. **Animation Composable** (Line ~3277)
   - Created `HabitDoneAnimationOverlay` composable
   - Full-screen overlay with fade in/out animations
   - 300dp size, centered on screen
   - Animation phases:
     * Fade in: 300ms
     * Hold: 3400ms
     * Fade out: 300ms
     * **Total: 4 seconds**
   - Blocks user interaction during animation
   - Infinite loop of Lottie animation for smooth playback

## Animation Behavior

### Trigger Conditions
- Animation triggers when user clicks the "Done" button on any habit card
- Works for all app themes (not theme-specific)
- Plays independently of Sharingan animation (Itachi theme has both)

### Visual Properties
- **Size:** 300dp × 300dp
- **Position:** Center of screen
- **Alpha Transition:** Smooth fade in/out with FastOutSlowInEasing
- **Interaction Blocking:** Prevents clicks during animation
- **Duration:** 4 seconds total (including fade transitions)

### Animation Lifecycle
1. User clicks "Done" button
2. `showHabitDoneAnimation` set to habit ID
3. Overlay appears with fade-in (300ms)
4. Animation plays for 3.4 seconds
5. Overlay fades out (300ms)
6. `showHabitDoneAnimation` reset to null
7. User can continue interacting

## Technical Notes

### State Management
- Uses nullable `Long?` to track which habit was completed
- `null` = no animation showing
- Non-null value = animation is active for that habit ID
- State automatically resets after animation completes

### Performance Considerations
- Lottie animation loops infinitely during display period
- No duplicate detection needed (all frames preserved for smooth playback)
- Hardware-accelerated graphics layer for optimal performance
- Minimal memory footprint (245.98 KB asset)

### Integration with Existing Features
- **Sharingan Animation (Itachi Theme):** Both animations can trigger simultaneously
- **Sound Effects:** Theme-specific completion sounds play as normal
- **Habit Completion:** Habit marked as complete before animation starts
- **Selection Mode:** Animation respects selection mode state

## Conversion Command Used
```powershell
.\convert-mp4.ps1 -InputFile "habit-done.mp4" -OutputName "habit_done_anim" -TargetFps 12 -Speed 1.0 -BackgroundMethod ai -SkipDuplicates $false
```

## Build Status
✅ **BUILD SUCCESSFUL**
- Compiled without errors
- Installed on device: RMX3750 - Android 15
- All 18 frames preserved for smooth animation
- Ready for testing and production use

## Future Enhancements
- Consider adding haptic feedback during animation
- Option to customize animation duration in settings
- Different animations for different achievement levels (streak milestones)
- Confetti particle effects for extra celebration
- Sound effects synchronized with animation timing
