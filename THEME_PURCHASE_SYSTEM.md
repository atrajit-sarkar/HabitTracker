## 🔧 Implementation Details

### 1. **Data Model Updates**

#### User.kt
```kotlin
data class User(
    ...
    val purchasedThemes: List<String> = listOf("DEFAULT")
)
```
- Added `purchasedThemes` field to track unlocked themes
- DEFAULT theme is always included

#### Theme.kt
```kotlin
enum class AppTheme(
    val displayName: String, 
    val emoji: String, 
    val price: Int = 0
)
```
- Added `price` parameter to AppTheme enum
- DEFAULT theme has price = 0 (free)
- All other themes cost 10 diamonds

### 2. **Backend Integration**

#### UserRewardsRepository.kt
Added three key methods:

1. **`getPurchasedThemes()`**
   - Retrieves list of purchased theme IDs from Firebase
   - Always includes "DEFAULT" for safety
   - Returns List<String>

2. **`purchaseTheme(themeId: String, cost: Int)`**
   - Transaction-safe purchase operation
   - Validates diamond balance
   - Checks if theme already purchased
   - Deducts diamonds and adds theme atomically
   - Returns success/failure boolean

3. **`initializeUserRewards()`**
   - Updated to initialize `purchased_themes` field
   - Sets DEFAULT theme for new users
   - Migration-safe for existing users

### 3. **ViewModel Integration**

#### HabitViewModel.kt
```kotlin
// State management
private val _purchasedThemes = MutableStateFlow<List<String>>(listOf("DEFAULT"))
val purchasedThemes: StateFlow<List<String>> = _purchasedThemes.asStateFlow()

// Purchase method
suspend fun purchaseTheme(themeId: String, cost: Int): Boolean
```
- Exposes purchased themes as StateFlow

3. **Purchase Confirmation Dialog**

   - Displays cost and current balance
   - "Purchase" button to confirm
   - "Cancel" button to dismiss
   - On success: Auto-applies theme immediately

4. **Smart Theme Cards**

   ThemeCard(
       theme: AppTheme,
       isSelected: Boolean,
       isUnlocked: Boolean,
       currentDiamonds: Int,
       onClick: () -> Unit
   )
   ```
