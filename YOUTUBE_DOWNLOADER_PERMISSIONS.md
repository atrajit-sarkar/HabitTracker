## üîí Permission Explained

### Why We Need Storage Permission?
- **To save files** in public folders (Downloads, Music, Documents)
- **To make files accessible** in your file manager
- **App-specific storage** doesn't need permission but files are hidden

### When Permissions Are Requested?
- **First time** you try to change folder location
- **Android 13+**: Requests "Access media files (audio)" permission
- **Android 9 and below**: Requests "Storage" permission
- **Android 10-12**: No permission needed for app-specific storage

## üéØ Folder Options Explained

| Folder | Location | Accessible? | Permissions Needed? |
|--------|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Downloads/HabitTracker** | `/storage/emulated/0/Download/HabitTracker` | ‚úÖ Yes, via file manager | ‚úÖ Yes (Android 13+) |
| **Music/HabitTracker** | `/storage/emulated/0/Music/HabitTracker` | ‚úÖ Yes, via file manager | ‚úÖ Yes (Android 13+) |
| **Documents/HabitTracker** | `/storage/emulated/0/Documents/HabitTracker` | ‚úÖ Yes, via file manager | ‚úÖ Yes (Android 13+) |
| **App Data (Private)** | `/Android/data/it.atraj.habittracker/files` | ‚ùå No, app only | ‚ùå No |

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Changes

### Files Modified:

1. **AndroidManifest.xml**
   - Added `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` (Android ‚â§12)
   - Added `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` (Android ‚â§12)
   - Added `READ_MEDIA_AUDIO` (Android 13+)

2. **YouTubeDownloaderViewModel.kt**
   - Added `getAvailableFolders()` - Lists all folder options
   - Updated default folder to use public Downloads
   - Android version-specific folder selection

3. **YouTubeDownloaderScreen.kt**
   - Added permission request launcher
   - Made folder card clickable
   - Added folder selection dialog
   - Visual indication of selected folder

4. **MediaDownloader.kt**
   - Already using the folder from ViewModel
   - No changes needed

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitation

**Video downloads are still audio-only** due to NewPipe-KMP API limitation:
- ‚úÖ **Audio downloads (MP3)**: Work perfectly
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Video downloads (MP4)**: Download audio only (no picture)
- This is a library limitation, not a bug

To get full video downloads with picture, we would need to:
- Integrate ffmpeg library (complex, 5-10 hours work)
- Or use yt-dlp (requires native binary)
- Or implement HLS/DASH segment downloader

## üéâ What You Can Do Now

1. ‚úÖ Download YouTube audio as MP3
2. ‚úÖ Choose where to save files (4 options)
3. ‚úÖ Access files via file manager (if using public folders)
4. ‚úÖ Share files with other apps
5. ‚úÖ Folder preference saved automatically
6. ‚úÖ No permission errors!

## üöÄ Next Steps (Optional)

If you want full video downloads with picture, I can help implement:

3. **ExoPlayer streaming** (stream instead of download)
