## 📊 Performance Metrics

### Optimizations Applied
- Throttled progress updates (500ms intervals)
- Chunked reading (8KB buffer)
- Lazy image loading with Coil
- Efficient recomposition with StateFlow
- Proper resource cleanup

### Expected Performance
- URL validation: < 1 second
- Metadata extraction: 2-3 seconds
- Download speed: Limited by network (typically 1-5 MB/s)
- Memory usage: ~20-40MB during download

## 🔧 Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist
```
□ Enter valid YouTube URL
□ Click "Fetch Video Info"
□ Verify metadata displays correctly
□ Select MP3 format

□ Test with MP4 format
□ Test error scenarios (invalid URL, no internet)
□ Test on different screen sizes
□ Test with long video titles
□ Test with high-resolution videos
```

### Edge Cases to Test
- Age-restricted videos
