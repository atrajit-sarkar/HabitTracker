## 💡 Important Notes

### For Play Store Upload:

1. **Use AAB, not APK!**
   - Play Store requires Android App Bundle (.aab)
   - Run: `.\build-playstore-bundle.ps1`
   - Not: `.\build-playstore-release.ps1` (that's APK)

2. **Keystore is Critical!**
   - NEVER lose your keystore file or passwords
   - Make multiple backups
   - Store in secure location
   - You can't update your app without it

3. **Privacy Policy Required!**
   - Must be hosted online (HTTPS)
   - Must be publicly accessible
   - Can't publish without it

4. **First Review Takes Longer**
   - Expect 3-7 days for first app
   - Usually 24-48 hours
   - Updates are faster (few hours to 1 day)

5. **Read Play Store Policies**
   - Most rejections are policy violations
   - Take 15 minutes to read them
   - https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy/

### Version Management:

**Current Version:**
- Version Name: 7.0.0
- Version Code: 20

**For Future Updates:**
```kotlin
// In app/build.gradle.kts
versionCode = 21  // Always increment by 1
versionName = "7.1.0"  // Semantic versioning
```

Then rebuild and upload new AAB to Play Store.
