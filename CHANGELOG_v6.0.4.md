##### New Functions
- `seekForward()` - Advance playback by 10 seconds
- `seekBackward()` - Rewind playback by 10 seconds
- `goToNextTrack()` - Navigate to next track
- `goToPreviousTrack()` - Navigate to previous track

##### Integration Updates
**MusicSettingsScreen.kt**:
- Passes full track list to music player
- Implements track change callback
- Maintains playback state across transitions
- Smooth track switching with 100ms delay

#### 📊 Performance Metrics

#### 🚀 Migration Guide

##### For Existing Implementations
If you're calling `MusicPlayerScreen` without the new parameters:
```kotlin
// Before (still works):
MusicPlayerScreen(
    track = track,
    isPlaying = isPlaying,
    currentVolume = volume,
    musicManager = manager,
    onBackClick = { },
    onVolumeChange = { },
    onPlayPauseClick = { }
)

// After (with new features):
MusicPlayerScreen(
    track = track,
    isPlaying = isPlaying,
    currentVolume = volume,
    musicManager = manager,
    onBackClick = { },
    onVolumeChange = { },
    onPlayPauseClick = { },
    allTracks = trackList,              // NEW: Enable navigation
    onTrackChange = { newTrack -> }     // NEW: Handle track changes
)
```

##### Recommended Next Steps
1. Integrate shuffle logic with BackgroundMusicManager
2. Implement repeat mode functionality in music service
3. Add favorite persistence to Firebase
4. Connect to backend for cross-device track sync
5. Add analytics for feature usage tracking
