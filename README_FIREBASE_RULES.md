## 🎓 Understanding the Rules

### Rule Structure
```javascript
match /path/{param} {
  allow read: if <condition>;   // When to allow reading
  allow write: if <condition>;  // When to allow writing
}
```

### Common Patterns
```javascript
// Only you can access your data
allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == userId;

// All authenticated users can read
allow read: if request.auth != null;

// Validate required fields
allow create: if request.resource.data.keys().hasAll(['field1', 'field2']);

// Check file types
allow write: if request.resource.contentType.matches('image/.*');
```
