# Music Repository Fix - Complete ✅

## Issue Fixed
Removed old `custom_music/` folder references from music.json in the HabitTracker-Music repository.

## What Was Done

### 1. Problem Identified
- Old song entry pointing to deleted `custom_music/` folder
- Song ID: `custom_1760954723664_eoBwm1gt`
- Title: "Primary:Purple Desire - The Grey Room   Clark Sims"
- URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../custom_music/1760954723576_Primary:Purple_Desire_-_The_Gr.mp3`

### 2. Solution Applied
✅ Pulled latest changes from GitHub
✅ Removed the old song entry from music.json
✅ Updated lastUpdated timestamp
✅ Committed and pushed to GitHub

### 3. Verification
✅ No `custom_music/` references remain in music.json
✅ Total songs: 18 (all official songs)
✅ Repository clean and ready for new uploads

## Current State

### Music.json Structure
- **Total Songs**: 18
- **Official Songs**: 18 (no uploadedBy field)
- **User Uploaded**: 0 (ready for new uploads)
- **Custom_music References**: 0 ✅

### New Upload Path
All new user uploads will use:
```
music/users/{userId}/{category}/{filename}
```

Example:
```
music/users/atrajit.sarkar/anime/song_name.mp3
```

## App Fetching Logic - Already Correct ✅

The app correctly identifies user songs by checking the `uploadedBy` field in metadata, NOT by URL path:

```kotlin
// From GitHubMusicService.kt
val userSongs = musicResponse.music.filter { it.isUserUploaded }

// MusicMetadata.kt
val isUserUploaded: Boolean
    get() = uploadedBy != null || source == "MANUAL"
```

### How It Works:
1. App fetches music.json from GitHub
2. Filters songs by `uploadedBy` field
3. Groups by user
4. Displays in user folders by category
5. Downloads from URL in metadata

## Test the Fix

### On Device:
1. Open HabitTracker app
2. Navigate to Music Browser
3. Check "User Music" section (should be empty initially)
4. Upload a new song using the upload feature
5. Verify it appears in your folder
6. Download and play the song

### Expected Behavior:
✅ No broken downloads (old custom_music song removed)
✅ New uploads work perfectly with new path structure
✅ Songs appear immediately after upload
✅ Download and playback work correctly
