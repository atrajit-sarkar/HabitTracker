The Bad Habit tracking feature helps users break unwanted app usage habits by:

   - Queries `UsageStatsManager` for app usage
   - Sends congratulations if app NOT used
   - Sends disappointment if app WAS used
   - Updates `lastAppUsageCheckDate`
   - Uses HiltWorker for dependency injection

2. **BadHabitNotificationService.kt** (NEW)
   ```kotlin
   object BadHabitNotificationService {
       fun sendEncouragementNotification(context: Context, habit: Habit)
       fun sendDisappointmentNotification(context: Context, habit: Habit, usageTimeMs: Long)
   }
   ```
   - Integrates with Gemini AI for personalized messages (100 char limit)

---

### ✅ **Task 4: Details Screen Calendar Updates** (COMPLETE)

#### Files Modified:
1. **HabitDetailsScreen.kt**
   - Updated `CalendarDay` composable with `isBadHabit` parameter
   - **Calendar Icon Logic for Bad Habits:**
     - ✓ (Green checkmark) when `isCompleted == true` (app not used)

     - Day number for today and future dates
     - Snowflake for freeze days (preserved)
   - **Background Colors:**
     - Light green (`0xFFE8F5E9`) for success days
     - Light red (`0xFFFFEBEE`) for failure days
   - **Manual Completion Disabled:**
     - Wrapped "Mark as Done" button in `if (!habit.isBadHabit)`

### ✅ **Task 5: End-of-Day Processing** (COMPLETE)

#### Files Modified:
1. **DailyCompletionReceiver.kt**
   - Added `processBadHabitsForToday()` function
   - Runs at **11:50 PM** daily (existing scheduler)
   - **Processing Logic:**
     ```kotlin
     For each bad habit:
       1. Check if already completed today → skip
       2. Get today's app usage via UsageStatsManager
       3. If usage == 0ms → Mark as completed (✓)
       4. If usage > 0ms → Leave unmarked (✗)
     ```
   - Added `getTodayUsageForApp()` helper function
   - Handles edge cases:
     - Custom app names without package → mark as completed (benefit of doubt)
     - Usage stats permission not granted → skip
     - Already completed → skip duplicate marking

## 🎨 Visual Design

### Home Screen Card
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🚫 BAD HABIT                        │ ← Gradient badge (red→orange)
│ Stop Using Instagram                │
│ Don't open Instagram today          │
│ Next: Every 2 hours                 │
│ 🔥 Streak: 5 days                   │
│                                     │
│ [        View Details        ]      │ ← Full-width button (no Done button)
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Details Screen Calendar
```
September 2024
S  M  T  W  T  F  S
                1  2
3  ✓  ✗  ✓  7  8  9    ← ✓ = avoided app, ✗ = used app
10 ✓  ✓  ✗  14 15 16
```

### Notifications

  ```
  🎉 Great Job! Keep Going!
  [Image: all-done.png]
  "You're doing amazing! 3 hours without Instagram - your streak is growing!"
  ```

- **Disappointment (app used):**
  ```
  📱 Oops! App Usage Detected
  [Image: more-overdue.png]
  "You used Instagram for 45 minutes today. Tomorrow is a new chance to succeed!"
  ```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### WorkManager Configuration
```kotlin
val workRequest = PeriodicWorkRequestBuilder<AppUsageTrackingWorker>(
    2, TimeUnit.HOURS,      // Every 2 hours
    30, TimeUnit.MINUTES    // 30min flex window
).setConstraints(
    Constraints.Builder()
        .setRequiredNetworkType(NetworkType.NOT_REQUIRED)
        .build()
).build()
```

### Permission Handling
```kotlin
// Check if PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS permission is granted
val usageStatsManager = context.getSystemService(Context.USAGE_STATS_SERVICE)
val stats = usageStatsManager.queryUsageStats(...)

if (stats == null || stats.isEmpty()) {
    // Permission not granted - show banner in AddBadHabitScreen
    // User must manually enable in Settings → Apps → Special access → Usage access
}
```

### Calendar Completion Logic
```kotlin
when {
    isBadHabit && isCompleted -> Show ✓ (success)
    isBadHabit && !isCompleted && isPastDate -> Show ✗ (failure)
    isBadHabit && isToday -> Show day number (pending)
}
```

## 📊 Data Flow

### Daily Cycle
```
12:00 AM - Day starts, usage tracking begins
02:00 AM - Check #1 (WorkManager)
04:00 AM - Check #2
06:00 AM - Check #3
...
10:00 PM - Check #11
11:50 PM - End-of-day processing (DailyCompletionReceiver)
           ↓
           Query UsageStatsManager for today's usage
           ↓
           Usage == 0? → Mark completed (✓)
           Usage > 0?  → Leave unmarked (✗)
```

### User Journey
```
1. User clicks FAB on home screen
2. Dialog shows: "Create Habit" or "Release Bad Habit"
3. User selects "Release Bad Habit"
4. AddBadHabitScreen:

   - Select app from list or enter custom name
   - Grant PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS permission
   - Save habit
5. WorkManager starts 2-hour checks
6. Notifications sent throughout day
7. At 11:50 PM, final check marks calendar
8. User opens Details screen, sees ✓ or ✗
```
