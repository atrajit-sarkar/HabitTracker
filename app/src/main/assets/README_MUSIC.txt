Background Music Files
======================

Place ambient music MP3 files in this directory with the following names:

- ambient_calm.mp3 (Peaceful ambient music)
- ambient_focus.mp3 (Focus-enhancing background music)
- ambient_nature.mp3 (Nature sounds ambient track)
- lofi_chill.mp3 (Lo-fi beats for relaxation)
- piano_soft.mp3 (Soft piano melody)

Recommended specifications:
- Format: MP3
- Bitrate: 128kbps (to keep app size small)
- Duration: 2-5 minutes (will loop)
- Volume: Normalized, not too loud

You can use royalty-free music from:
- Pixabay Music
- YouTube Audio Library
- FreePD
- Incompetech

The app will gracefully handle missing files and continue to work without background music.
