## ⚠️ Known Issues

### YouTube Downloader Feature

**Status**: UI Complete, Backend Temporarily Disabled

**Issue**: NewPipe Extractor library dependency resolution failure

- ❌ Downloads are non-functional

**Error Message Users Will See**:
> "YouTube extraction feature is currently unavailable. NewPipe library dependency needs to be fixed."

**Solution Required**:
1. Find a working NewPipe Extractor version, OR
2. Switch to alternative library (youtube-dl-android, YTExtractor), OR
3. Implement custom YouTube API solution

**Files to Fix When Library Works**:
- `app/build.gradle.kts` - Uncomment NewPipe dependency
- `app/src/main/java/.../youtube/YouTubeExtractor.kt` - Uncomment all NewPipe code

## 📝 Next Steps

### Priority 1: Fix YouTube Extractor Library

**Option A**: Use Alternative Library
```kotlin
// Instead of NewPipe, try:
implementation("com.github.HaarigerHarald:android-youtubeExtractor:v2.1.0")
```

**Option B**: Use YouTube Data API v3
- Requires API key from Google Cloud Console
- Limited free quota (10,000 units/day)
- More reliable but requires API key management

**Option C**: Wait for NewPipe Fix
- Check JitPack build status
- Try different version numbers
- Check NewPipe GitHub for latest stable release

### Priority 2: Testing
- Test all existing features for regressions
- Verify navigation works smoothly
- Check memory usage
- Test on different screen sizes

### Priority 3: Polish
- Add disclaimer for YouTube downloader feature
- Update documentation with library fix instructions
- Consider adding "Coming Soon" badge on disabled features
