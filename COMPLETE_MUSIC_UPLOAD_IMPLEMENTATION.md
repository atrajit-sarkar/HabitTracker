# Complete Music Upload Implementation

## ‚úÖ Fully Functional Song Upload System

### Implementation Date: October 22, 2025

## üéØ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Full Upload Functionality**
- ‚úÖ File picker integration for selecting MP3 files
- ‚úÖ Read file data from URI and convert to ByteArray
- ‚úÖ Upload songs to GitHub repository via API
- ‚úÖ Automatic music.json update after successful upload
- ‚úÖ Real-time upload progress tracking
- ‚úÖ Error handling with user-friendly messages

### 2. **Music.json Auto-Update**
- Fetches current music.json from GitHub
- Parses existing songs
- Adds new song metadata with proper structure
- Gets file SHA for update operation
- Updates music.json on GitHub with new song entry
- New songs appear immediately in the app UI

### 3. **Added Anime Category**
Categories now include:
- Ambient
- **Anime** (NEW!)
- Classical
- Electronic
- Focus
- Nature
- Meditation
- Upbeat
- Relaxing

## üìã How It Works

### Upload Flow:
```
1. User selects MP3 file from device
2. User fills in song details (title, artist, category)
3. Click "Upload Song" button
4. App reads file data into memory
5. Upload to GitHub: /music/users/{userId}/{category}/{filename}
6. Fetch current music.json
7. Parse existing songs
8. Add new song metadata
9. Update music.json on GitHub
10. Success message shown
11. Song immediately available in app
```

### Song Metadata Structure:
```kotlin
{
  "id": "1729612345_user123:My Song",
  "title": "My Song",
  "artist": "Artist Name",
  "category": "anime",
  "url": "https://github.com/.../song.mp3",
  "duration": 0,
  "tags": ["anime"],
  "uploadedBy": "user123",
  "uploaderName": "User Display Name",
  "source": "MANUAL"
}
```

## üîß Technical Details

### Files Modified:

#### 1. **GitHubMusicService.kt**
```kotlin
// Added GITHUB_RAW_BASE constant
private const val GITHUB_RAW_BASE = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com"

// Implemented full updateMusicMetadata()
private suspend fun updateMusicMetadata(
    userId: String,
    songData: SongUploadData,
    downloadUrl: String
): Result<Unit> {
    // 1. Fetch current music.json
    // 2. Parse existing songs
    // 3. Create new song metadata
    // 4. Get file SHA for update
    // 5. Encode updated JSON to Base64
    // 6. Update music.json on GitHub
}

// Added internal data class
@Serializable
private data class MusicJsonData(
    val songs: List<MusicMetadata>
)
```

#### 2. **MusicBrowserViewModel.kt**
```kotlin
// Added upload method
suspend fun uploadSong(
    userId: String,
    songData: SongUploadData
): Result<GitHubUploadResponse> {
    return gitHubMusicService.uploadSong(userId, songData)
}
```

#### 3. **SongUploadScreen.kt**
```kotlin
// Added Anime category
val categories = listOf(
    "Ambient",
    "Anime",  // NEW!
    "Classical",
    ...
)

// Implemented actual upload logic
scope.launch {
    // Get current user
    val userId = currentUser.email?.substringBefore("@") ?: currentUser.uid
    val uploaderName = currentUser.displayName ?: "Unknown"
    
    // Create upload data
    val uploadData = SongUploadData(
        fileName = selectedFileName,
        category = selectedCategory.lowercase(),
        fileData = fileData,
        title = songTitle,
        artist = artistName,
        uploaderName = uploaderName,
        duration = 0,
        tags = listOf(selectedCategory.lowercase())
    )
    
    // Upload via ViewModel
    val result = musicBrowserViewModel.uploadSong(userId, uploadData)
    
    // Handle success/failure
    result.onSuccess { ... }
          .onFailure { ... }
}
```

#### 4. **GitHubModels.kt**
```kotlin
// Added uploaderName field
data class SongUploadData(
    val fileName: String,
    val category: String,
    val fileData: ByteArray,
    val title: String,
    val artist: String,
    val uploaderName: String = "",  // NEW!
    val duration: Int = 0,
    val tags: List<String> = emptyList()
)
```
